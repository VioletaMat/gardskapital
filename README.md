# Getting Started

This React project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Project was edited and adapted as a task for a job offer at ZWEBB Fintech

First,
clone project somewhere and create your local copy
then navigate folder

run npm install
or
yarn install

you will get npm error while resolving typescript version with i18next library i use for localisation
please run 
npm install --legacy-peer-deps --force

This will bypass the dependency resolution conflict. Till i resolve this conflict. 	:bug:

then run the development server:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
